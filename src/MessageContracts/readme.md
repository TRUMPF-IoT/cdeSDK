# Message Contracts

These projects provide definitions for message contracts (nsCDEngine.BaseClasses.TSM payloads etc.) for  plug-ins that are commonly used by applications or other plug-ins as building blocks in a distributed  IIoT solution.

Plug-ins that implement these message contracts are (or will shortly be) in the C-DEPlugins depot.
